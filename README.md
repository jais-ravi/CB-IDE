🌩️ Cloud IDE Platform

A modern cloud-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) featuring per-project Docker container isolation, real-time code editing, file management, integrated terminal access, and dynamic public URLs — built for scalability, security, and seamless developer experience.

🚀 Features
	•	Multi-language support (Node.js, Python, Java, C++, etc.)
	•	Isolated Docker containers per project for secure project environments
	•	Real-time file explorer and editor with auto-save functionality
	•	Integrated Terminal (via node-pty and socket.io) inside the browser
	•	Dynamic Public URLs for live project previews using reverse proxy (Traefik)
	•	Resource Limits (CPU/RAM) for each container
	•	Idle container auto-shutdown for cost efficiency
	•	Authentication system (Firebase authentication integration ready)
	•	CI/CD-inspired Git push workflows (future)
	•	Scalable architecture (Docker Swarm-ready for future horizontal scaling)
