Perfect — you’re almost there.
Let me expand and complete this README.md properly, while keeping the structure you started:

⸻

🌩️ Cloud IDE Platform

A modern cloud-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) featuring per-project Docker container isolation, real-time code editing, file management, integrated terminal access, and dynamic public URLs — built for scalability, security, and seamless developer experience.

⸻

🚀 Features
	•	🌐 Multi-language support (Node.js, Python, Java, C++, etc.)
	•	🔒 Isolated Docker containers per project for secure and independent environments
	•	📝 Real-time file explorer and editor with auto-save functionality
	•	🖥️ Integrated terminal inside the browser (powered by Node-PTY and Socket.IO)
	•	🌍 Dynamic Public URLs for live project previews (via Traefik reverse proxy)
	•	📊 Resource Limits (CPU/RAM) enforced per container
	•	💤 Idle container auto-shutdown for cost efficiency
	•	🔐 Authentication system ready (Firebase authentication integration)
	•	🔄 CI/CD-inspired Git push workflows (planned for future versions)
	•	📈 Scalable architecture, Docker Swarm-ready for horizontal scaling

⸻

🛠 Tech Stack

Layer	Tech
Frontend	Next.js, TailwindCSS, Monaco Editor, Socket.IO Client
Backend	Node.js (Express), Dockerode, Node-PTY, Socket.IO Server
Containers	Docker
Reverse Proxy	Traefik (dynamic routing & SSL termination)



⸻

⚡ Key Components
	•	Container Manager
Create, start, stop, monitor, and delete per-project Docker containers dynamically through the backend API.
	•	Terminal Bridge
Real-time WebSocket connections to the container’s shell using Node-PTY and Socket.IO, allowing command execution from the browser.
	•	File Explorer
Browse, edit, create, rename, and delete files and directories inside the container filesystem. Changes are synchronized live with the container.
	•	Public URL Generator
Automatically generate a dynamic public URL for each project container using Traefik, enabling live preview of web applications.
	•	Idle Monitor
Detects inactivity and shuts down idle containers automatically after a configured timeout, saving system resources.

📂 Project Structure

/frontend             # Next.js frontend (editor, terminal, file explorer)
/backend              # Node.js backend (container manager, websocket server)
/docker-templates     # Language-specific Dockerfiles (Node, Python, Java, etc.)
/scripts              # Utility scripts (idle shutdown, health checks)



⸻

🧩 Setup & Installation

Requirements
	•	Node.js v18+
	•	Docker Engine
	•	Docker Compose
	•	(Optional) Traefik reverse proxy setup
	•	(Optional) Firebase project (for authentication)

Local Development

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cloud-ide.git
cd cloud-ide

# Setup Backend
cd backend
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev

# Setup Frontend
cd ../frontend
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run dev

Access the IDE at: http://localhost:3000

🔧 Configuration

Backend Environment Variables (backend/.env)

PORT=4000
DOCKER_NETWORK=cloudide_network
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
TRAEFIK_API_URL=http://localhost:8080

Frontend Environment Variables (frontend/.env)

NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key



⸻

🔒 Security Highlights
	•	Container Isolation: Every project runs in a dedicated, isolated Docker container.
	•	Volume and Network Isolation: Containers have limited access and predefined networks.
	•	Resource Limits: Prevent any single project from exhausting system CPU or memory.
	•	Authentication: Firebase authentication integration (optional).
	•	HTTPS Support: Easy SSL setup with Traefik and Let’s Encrypt (production-ready).

⸻

📈 Roadmap
	•	Per-project container management
	•	Real-time code editor and file management
	•	Integrated browser-based terminal
	•	Dynamic public URL previews
	•	Idle container auto-shutdown
	•	Collaborative coding sessions (multiple users in same project)
	•	GitHub import/export integration
	•	Git push triggers (auto-deploy builds)
	•	Multi-region deployment support (global scaling)
